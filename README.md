# course-trader-app

We are designing a Service-Oriented Architecture design to provide features for a incoming/existing student to have course selection, exchange, 1-1 as well as public discussion features to help them get the course that they want. We are using google-app-engine as a PasS platform to deploy our app using different services for each of the use cases discussed.
