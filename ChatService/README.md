ChatService
To provide a platform to users who have established a channel through 1-1 chat required for the exchange of courses


It is based off the project: https://github.com/rexeze/anonymouse-realtime-chat-app . It has been modified and tested to make it work as 1:1 chat service instead of just broadcasting message to all users.
